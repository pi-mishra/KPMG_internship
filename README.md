   Skills Learned - ANALYTICAL DASHBOARD CREATION, CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION, DATA ANALYTICS, DATA DASHBOARDS, DATA DRIVEN PRESENTATIONS, DATA QUALITY ANALYSIS, DATA VISUALISATIONS, PRESENTATIONS

We have been shared 3 data sheet (Transaction, Customer Address, Customer Demographic). The Data quality assessment is shared below.

| Sheet Name    | Total Number of columns | Total Number of records | Unique customer_id |
| ------------- | ------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------|
| Transaction   | 13	| 20000 | 3494
Customer Address | 6	| 3999 | 3999
Customer Demographic | 13	| 4000	| 4000

•	Null values – There are multiple null values in transaction and customer demographic sheet. Reason of null values should be checked weather the customers are not willing to provide or the error is from the companies end.

•	Data type not specified – There are multiple columns whose datatype is not specified or incorrect. Make sure while creating a database each column datatype should be specified.

•	Uninformative column – There is one column that contains no information just some random scientific notations. It might be due to wrong fetching of data or the database is not created properly, it should be checked.

•	Location error – Names of locations are not mentioned properly, if not maintained properly one location will be divided into multiple locations.


This are the first observation we have found the above issues. We will further analyse the data, perform data cleaning, and transform the data for further use. Questions will be raised along the way and assumptions documented.
